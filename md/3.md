Of course, I had to list my own portfolio *on* my own portfolio!  For this website, I made a simple blog-like static website generator; and the front end I made from scratch, with the help of Bootstrap.

You can build all of the posts by running the following commands in the project directory:
```sh
npm install
node build
```

There was a previous version that didn't have a static website generator that was made in only HTML and CSS, but I decided to re-design the website and give it a nicer look, including a dark theme.
