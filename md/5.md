Randomize is a very basic drop randomizer for Minecraft.  Whenever a mob is killed or a block is broken, it drops a random item.  As long as the drop seed doesn't change, the drops will always be the same.  For example, if one dirt block drops a gold block, any other dirt block will also drop a gold block.

## Notes
- The plugin doesn't support loot tables, meaning that it can't drop anything like village chest items, etc.
- The plugin allows randomized amounts of drops.
