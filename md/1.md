BungeeParty is a simple party system I made for my own Minecraft server when I was developing it.  Of course, it is made for BungeeCord, meaning it has cross server support.

## Commands
The BungeeParty plugin includes several commands for managing parties.  I won't go into full detail for the commands since they are listed in the Github [README.md file](https://github.com/trimorphdev/BungeeParty#readme).

BungeeParty's main command is `/p`, which can be used to manage parties with its subcommands.

## Notes
- As of writing this, to make all players join your server when you are hosting a party, you need to use the `/p warp` command, players don't automatically warp to your server.  This may change in the future.
- There currently is no way for an adminstrator to "hijack" someone else's party.
