Ash is a web framework made for Deno, with an API inspired by [Laravel](//laravel.com/), which is a PHP web framework.

A simple example of an Ash application would look like this:
```ts
import { Route, ash } from 'https://deno.land/x/ash/mod.ts';

Route.get('/', () => {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
});

ash.start();
```
