Deno Depd is a library for deprecating functions in Deno.  It was largely inspired by the [Depd Node.js package](//www.npmjs.com/package/depd).

Here's a quick example of it in action:

```ts
import depd from 'https://deno.land/x/depd/mod.ts';

const deprecated = depd('my package name');

const func = deprecated(function myDeprecatedFunction() {
    console.log('This should output a warning.');
});

func();
/*
=> [WARNING] Package my package name deprecated 'func()'.
*/
```

It also has the ability to throw an error when the function is called.
