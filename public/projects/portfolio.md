# trimorphdev.github.io
This website was coded by hand, from the ground up, with Bootstrap  (with syntax highlighting powered by Highlight.js).  It is its own "Static Site Generator", which generates all of the HTML source ahead-of-time.  What you're viewing right now is actually the third revision to the project and it has some significant changes to the static site generator, including Yaml Metadata:

```markdown
<!-- Metadata -->
---
title: My Page
---

## My Page
...
```

It uses EJS (a wonderful templating library) behind the scenes to generate the web pages from the template `index.html` file at `public/index.html`.
